# OOP-in-Java


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java: A collection of 90+ Java programs showcasing OOP concepts learned during my semester, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and more. Also includes two Java Swing-based varsity projects with their source code, small overview presentations for each project, and two university-level question sets (MID and Final term) created by me to help boost your knowledge.
